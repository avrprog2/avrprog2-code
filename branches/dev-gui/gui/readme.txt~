@page readme

Another Linux tool for the MikroElektronika (www.mikroe.com) AVRprog2 programming hardware.
This GUI allows the user to select their mcu, frequency, hex file, and fuse/lock bits. Then the selected hex file can be written to the attached device with the click of a button. 

@section cai Compile and Install

The following libraries are needed to compile this project:

// TODO: make list of libraries

AVRprog2 is required to be installed separately. //TODO: combine source codes for one install
Also, Qt5.4 is required to compile from source. //TODO: merge code so that Qt is not a dependancy

compile and install with:

@code
qmake
make
sudo make install
@endcode

Another important make target is
make doc

This will generate a html documentation of the source.

The application is configurable within avrprog.h:
- WRITE_FUSES_SUPPORT: turn on/off writing of fuse bytes
- CONFIG_DIR: system wide configuration directory
- HOME_CONFIG_DIR: user specific configuration directory

@section Usage

// TODO: write usage - attach man.txt to gui - attach man pages to gui?
